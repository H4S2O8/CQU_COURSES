Hello GitHub Education Team, my name is Hu Zhecheng. I am a student majoring in Computer Science from Chong Qing University. 
For your convenience, the information on my student card is translated into English by myself. As you can see on the first image, my enrollment date is September 20th, 2020. I am sorry that my university's educational email has banned @github.com from sending them email, so I cannot apply for a Student Develop Pack with my education email. But I am in the most real attitude to ensure my identity as a college student. 
With a love of website design in mind, I want to build a website with wordpress architecture. The resources provided by GitHub education are very valuable and helpful to my project. I sincerely hope that I can get a approval from GitHub Education Team and boost my project at most.
